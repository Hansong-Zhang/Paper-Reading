# Bibtex of Label Noise
***
## Label Noise General
+ Image classification with deep learning in the presence of noisy labels: A survey
+ Classification in the presence of label noise: a survey
+ A survey of label-noise representation learning: Past, present and future
+ Deep learning with noisy labels: Exploring techniques and remedies in medical image analysis
***
## Memory Effect
+ A closer look at memorization in deep networks
+ Do we need zero training loss after achieving zero training error?
+ Understanding deep learning (still) requires rethinking generalization
***
## Learning from Crowds
### Majority Voting
+ Whose vote should count more: Optimal integration of labels from labelers of unknown expertise.
+ Ensemble Methods: Foundations and Algorithms.
+ Beyond majority voting: A coarse-to-fine label filtration for heavily noisy labels.
